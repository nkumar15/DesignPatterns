/*

Intent
------------
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. [GoF, p175]
Client-specified embellishment of a core object by recursively wrapping it.
Wrapping a gift, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.


Requirement
----------
Sometimes we want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire
class. A graphical user interface toolkit, for example, should let you add
properties like borders or behaviors like scrolling to any user interface
component.
One way to add responsibilities is with inheritance. Inheriting a border from
another class puts a border around every subclass instance. This is inflexible,
however, because the choice of border is made statically. A client can't control
how and when to decorate the component with a border.
A more flexible approach is to enclose the component in another object that adds
the border. The enclosing object is called a decorator.

*One common interface, Interface
*one core class , which inherits from interface
*one decorator class, which inherits from interface + creates a Interface member inside (composition of interface )
*Defined each decorator derived class from decorator class.
*Decorator derived classes implement their wrapper functionality - and - delegate to the Decorator base class.
*The client configures the type and ordering of Core and Decorator objects.


Examples
-----------
The Decorator attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. The ornaments that are added to pine or fir trees are examples of Decorators. Lights, garland, 
candy canes, glass ornaments, etc., can be added to a tree to give it a festive look. The ornaments do not change the tree itself which is recognizable as a Christmas tree 
regardless of particular ornaments used. As an example of additional functionality, the addition of lights allows one to "light up" a Christmas tree.

-----------
Adapter: A decorator is different from an adapter in that a decorator only
changes an object's responsibilities, not its interface; an adapter will give
an object a completely new interface.

Composite : A decorator can be viewed as a degenerate composite with only
one component. However, a decorator adds additional responsibilitiesâ€”it isn't
intended for object aggregation.

Strategy : A decorator lets you change the skin of an object; a strategy
lets you change the guts. These are two alternative ways of changing an object.
