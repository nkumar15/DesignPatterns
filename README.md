    * Singleton
    * Abstract Factory
    * Factory Method
    * Builder
    * Prototype
    * Object Pool

* Structural patterns :  Are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
    
* Behavioral patterns :  Are concerned with algorithms and theassignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patternsdescribe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patternsof communication between them.
    * Chain of responsibilty
    * Command
    * Interpretor
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memmento
    * Observer
    * State
